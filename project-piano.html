<p class="ptext">For about two years now, I have been taking piano lessons through the school of MPMA, the Mid-Peninnsula Music Academy. I have had two teachers so far, both of which have been amazing in helping me increase my skill in piano playing, reading, and compositions.</p>

<p class="ptext">My first main project was working on a group of four miniatures to be played by a English horn and Oboe duo. Titled "Bluer Oceans", I took inspiration from a lot of my favorite soundtracks, mostly from videogames.
  <br><em>For example, the piece "Field" was heavily inspired by the piece "Field - Day" from The Legend of Zelda : Breath of the Wild).</em>
  <br>Several of the other pieces in this collection were originally created from a prompt from my piano teacher, and then adapted into a piece that fit the overall theme of this collection.</p>

<p class="ptext">This piano suite was created with my second teacher. Similar to Bluer Oceans, this collection was originally founded by pieces that I created without the collection in mind first, but then adapted to fit into this suite later on.
<br>Although there are only three pieces in this suite, "Jagged Mountains" is an especially long piece that makes the first two seem like buildup to it, which was somewhat intended.
<br>With this suite, I tried to focus more on the overall feeling of the pieces combined, now that I had experience with creating a collection. The title page was an aspect I especially focused on, as the presentation of the pieces can help shape your listening experience of the pieces themselves.</p>
