<p class="ptext">Celeste is an indie platformer where a girl tries to climb a mountain. It is exceptionally harder than most platformers (around Super Meat Boy difficulty), and, as I discovered, there is a large modding community behind the game.<br>On February 1st, 2021, the next big collab, Strawberry Jam 2021, was announced. Collabs are where many people within the community make their own map and have it all put together, separated by difficulty, into one large map-pack that is released to the public. This is my first collab I have taken part in, and it has been an amazing experience so far.</p>

<p class="ptext">To make maps, I ues a community-made program called Ahorn that allows you to place tiles, entities, decoration, triggers, and more. There is a lot of steps to creating an amazing map, but luckily there was many people on the Strawberry Jam discord (as well as the official Celeste community discord) that are willing to help you figure out any errors and give you feedback. In fact, you are specifically assigned playtesters that will playtest your map and give you feedback, and there are captains that oversee each difficulty category of maps who are extremely helpful and accessible.</p>

<p class="ptext"><b>Note: Due to the Strawberry Jam Collab not being released yet, I will not be posting pictures of or talking about my map yet.
