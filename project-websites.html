<p class="ptext">During high school I found myself making websites for various clubs. I have helped work on websites for 2 different clubs. One was for the Game and Animation Club (AKA G/A Club), made from scratch, and the other was for my school's official athletics program, d.athletics, which was made alongside a team of club members.</p>

<p class="ptext">This website for the d.athletics team was made with a few other team members on Wix. It was much easier to collaborate on and create something that looked good on Wix, but it doesn't allow for as much control than doing it from scratch. The picture shown above is the site's landing page.</p>
