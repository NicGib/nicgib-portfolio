    <h2 class="ptext-header">The Flame Yearbook</h2>

    <p class="ptext">I have been on d.tech's yearbook team for two years, starting as a page designer my sophomore year. My school's yearbook is spilt up into 4 sections with different teams--my section being Academics, which involves documenting all classes at d.tech. As a page designer, I worked on making spreads/layouts for where pictures and text should go for every page within the Academics section, as well as putting the actual pictures and text into the finalized spreads. I also had to do a lot of revision throughout the whole process, as space is limited and new pictures and updated text can come in gradually as the school year goes on.
<br><br>For my second year on the yearbook team, I ran for and was voted in as a section editor for the Academics section. (I chose this section to run for since it was the one I had the most experience with.) The responsibilities of a section editor are a lot more than a page designer, since I had to keep track of not just page designers, but also photographers and writers. Luckily, there are other section editors that you can rely on, as well as the two student co-editors in chief, who are both really helpful.
  <br>Beside the fact that I had many new duties to perform, this year was especially unique for me since the yearbook was worked on through entirely virtual means.
<br><br>This senior year, I am going to be acting as a co-editor in chief. This means that I will be one of the people I looked up to last year and the year before, and it will bring a lot of new responsibilities. It will be a challenge, but I hope to keep my head up, communicate with my team well (especially now that we might be able to go in-person this year), and create another amazing yearbook.

  Above, you can see some of my work as a page designer during my sophomore year. My main focus when designing spreads was to make the structuring unique and flow well. I tried to avoid making standard square groupings with the pictures, and I also made a lot of changes over time in terms of picture placements--in order to get the flow just right. Interestingly, this work was largely what I relied on when talking about page-designing to my page designers last year as a section editor.
