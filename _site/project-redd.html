    <h2 class="ptext-header">Redd</h2>
    <p class="ptext">Redd is a chatbot made for the non-profit organization "Save the Redwoods League". This group is all about saving the redwoods, and they help protect, revive, research, and raise awareness for all redwood forests within California. Their website had 50+ pages, and too much information was condensed within those pages, or hidden behind hard-to-find links.
    <br><br>Redd originally started in a 2 week class led by Oracle. <em>(since my school was founded by Oracle and we have a lot of contact with their team)</em>. It was a prototype, and although I worked with a team, they were randomly assigned--and later on our group broke up. However, later on I met with Nicholas Sounthong, who would become a partner in this project, and Ashley, an employee from Oracle willing to help us continue our project. Eventually, after many hours of meetings and work, we were given a chance to go to Oracle Open-World. This prestigious event was held in San Francisco, and d.tech was given a spot on the showfloor to showcase student works such as ours. </p>
    <div class="pdivider-small"></div>
    <p class="ptext">Redd was made with Oracle's chatbot builder, a program which we were introduced to during the original Oracle class. Redd was made to have an "old redwood tree" type of personality, so many of their responses would be tweaked subtly to make it seem like it was very knowledgable and wise. Redd's main purpose is to help you find what you are looking for, so we made sure that it could find out what the user wanted to know, so that it could then direct them to a page on the Save The Redwoods website. </p>
    <p class="ptext">At Oracle Open World, Nick and I were in an area and given an individual booth along with many other d.tech students with innovative projects. We also had Save The Redwoods near us in their own booth, where they had a photo shoot and their own info station. Nick and I were able to showcase our project to many people in the technology and data industry, and it was really a unique experience overall.</p>
