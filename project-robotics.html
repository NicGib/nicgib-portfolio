<p class="ptext">Ever since my freshman year, I have been a part of my school's First Robotics Competition robotics team, titled B.R.E.A.D. (or BREAD). I have been a part of the CAD team for robotics three years (and counting), and on the Spirit team two years.<br>Being on CAD, I have had a lot of experience with making 3D models and designing around technical limitations. For example, some of the CAD projects that I have been invovled in include making the outer frame and bumpers of the robot, making an intake prototype, making a mechanism that will spin a wheel, and more.</p>

<p class="ptext">As part of hte Spirit team, I have worked on some small creations such as stickers and pins, but the main focus of the Spirit team is working on the team's custom t-shirts. Each Spirit team member would create their own design and submit it to be voted on and chosen as the shirt we would produce. Although my design did not get picked, it was a ton of fun to work on, and overall being in the Spirit team has taught me a lot about graphic design--as well as the technical process of making a piece of merchandise and selling it.</p>
