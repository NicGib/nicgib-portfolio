<p class="ptext"><a class="onwhite" target="blank" href="https://linktr.ee/vocalicious">Vocalicious</a> is Santa Clara University's largest all-gender a cappella group since 2018. Made up of ~20 members and with voice parts ranging from bass to soprano to beatboxing, their style ranges from the indie tunes of Ginger Root to the bossa nova of Laufey, all the way up to pop hits from Justin Timberlake and Christina Perri. They are also the first acappella group from SCU to go to ICCA, the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella.
<br><br>
Within the group, Nicolas acts as a bass group member (2022-present), and the group's Social Media Manager (2023-present).
<br><br>
Vocalicious group members participate in weekly meetings in preparation for live a cappella performances. They sing in individual, sectional, and full-range groups, while communicating and socially engaging with other members outside of meetings.
<br><br>
As a social media manager, Nicolas executes Vocalicious' cross-platform social marketing campaign to increase media presence and brand visibility through effective media networking.
<br><br>
He has redesigned their brand logo & iterated upon their brand identity to enable longevity and greater recognizability. He has created a style guide, internal presentations, plus the group's TikTok, Instagram, and Youtube video content. Furthermore, he has created pamphlets and marketing material for livestreamed, end-of-quarter a cappella events.
This brand expansion has helped the group feel more connected and confident, made it easier for others to learn about the group, as well as increased visibility to non-musical / non-acappella audiences.
<br><br>
A brand new Vocalicious website is planned for the near future.
