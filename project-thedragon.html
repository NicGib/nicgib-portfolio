<p class="ptext">For two years, I have been doing illustrations for my school's official newspaper, called "The Dragon Newspaper". Along with being an artist, I have also worked as the role of Art Director for the newspaper team this last year, which has me helping assign art to artists on the team.</p>

<p class="ptext">My original comics, shown above, were some of the first art pieces that I did for The Dragon Newspaper. These pieces helped be gain confidence that people liked my work, and allowed me to be more recognized as an artist at my high school overall.</p>

<p class="ptext">The rest of the pieces that you see here are all done for a specific article. For example, I have actually written several articles for The Dragon, and I have created illustrations to go along with my writing.</p>
