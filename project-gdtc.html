  The Global Digital Transformation Clinic (GDTC) is part of the <a class="onwhite" target="blank" href="http://www.scu.edu/engineering/frugal/">SCU Frugal Innovation Hub</a>, which focuses on humanitarian engineering and technology.
  Specifically, the GDTC focuses on helping social enterprises, non-profit organizations, and governmental programs who operate in low-resource settings embrace technology via mobile and web applications.

  The site runs through SCU's TerminalFour (or "T4") web system, which is the service hosting all of SCU's webpages. After gaining technical experience with T4, I plan to restructure their page for easier content flow and accessibility.
