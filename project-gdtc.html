  The Global Digital Transformation Clinic (GDTC) is part of the <a class="onwhite" target="blank" href="http://www.scu.edu/engineering/frugal/">SCU Frugal Innovation Hub</a>, which focuses on humanitarian engineering and technology.
  Specifically, the GDTC focuses on helping social enterprises, non-profit organizations, and governmental programs who operate in low-resource settings embrace technology via mobile and web applications.

<br><br>
The site runs through SCU's TerminalFour (or "T4") web system, which is the service hosting all of SCU's webpages. After gaining technical experience with T4, I plan to restructure their page for easier content flow and accessibility.
